# Works of Julia Balbilla
## Edited and encoded by Gabriel Bodard (Institute of Classical Studies) 

This project will involve a digital edition and analysis of the extant works of [Julia Balbilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Balbilla), a Comagene/Roman princess and poet who accompanied the Emperor Hadrian and Empress Sabinna on their visit to Thebes in Egypt in 130 CE. In part an experiment in digital encoding and publlication, I conceived of this edition in order to practice as many as possible of the digital philological techniques taught in the [Sunoikisis Digital Classics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjwSzxMtwDaPu6JvG1GquOw) programme and related courses (including tools and methods I introduce to my students in the [Digital Classics](https://ics.sas.ac.uk/students/ma-modules-intercollegiate-degree/ics02-digital-classics-linking-written-and-material) module at the ICS). I will explore how to annotate, relation, combine, document, publish and disseminate the various methods, tools and outputs involved, with an eye on usability, stability, sustainability, transparency and scholarly attribution. Results and discussion will be posted here over time.
